# expint

Python function for evaluation of exponential integrals, E<sub>n</sub>(x), with real values, _not just integers_, of the order "n" from the paper by Navas-Palencia (2018) in the journal Numerical Algorithms, doi:[10.1007/s11075-017-0331-z](http://doi.org/10.1007/s11075-017-0331-z). 

The exponential integral (see also `scipy.special.expn`) can be related to the upper incomplete gamma function:

![\begin{align*}
\Gamma(s,x) = x^s E_{(1-s)}(x) \equiv x^s E_n(1-s,x),
\end{align*}
](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLarge+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cbegin%7Balign%2A%7D%0A%5CGamma%28s%2Cx%29+%3D+x%5Es+E_%7B%281-s%29%7D%28x%29+%5Cequiv+x%5Es+E_n%281-s%2Cx%29%2C%0A%5Cend%7Balign%2A%7D%0A)

`scipy.special.expn` can only cope with integer values of the order, and most (all?) gamma function routines I tried also relied on positive integer order, so forget about calculating `Î“(-0.8,x)`, if that's something you find you need to do...

My main reason for posting this here, _since the code is available on the journal website as a supplement_, was because I needed to make a few tweaks in order to install the package successfully:
1. Replace the includes path in `expint.i`.
1. The code is written in `C++` and then wrapped for Python using `swig`, so I run `swig -c++ -python expint.i` to generate `expint.py`.
1. Create a `setup.py` script.
1. Compile using python: `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
1. Put the pyexpint folder somewhere in my `PYTHONPATH` and link `expint.py` to `__init__.py`
1. `import expint` as usual, and success!
